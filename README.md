#Space Mission Assignment#
Hello!
This is my first portfolio project for JavaScript.

You should be able to run the code in VSCode or similar editors.

This program is designed to randomly assign a destination, a mission type, and a spaceship.

Exploration is currently restricted to our solar system.

To make it a little more fun there are a few messages that are almost funny, and a couple easter eggs if you get certain outputs.

each time you run the program you should get a different output. Give it a try!
